A stateless photo library service to run on your NAS.

Still very much a work-in-progress ðŸ™ˆ.

## Development

Lumine has a dependency to ImageMagick, therefore is recommended to use docker-compose while development.

Install dependencies:

```
docker-compose run client yarn
```

Start development servers:

```
docker-compose up
```
