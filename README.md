# lumine

A self-hosted library for your photos.

- Nothing to manage, the library automatically categorises everything;
- Library should be "stateless", the actual files are the source of truth;
- Should be fast to view previews of the images;

**This repository is very early work-in-progress... don't expect anything to work.**
